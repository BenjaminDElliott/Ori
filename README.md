Simple Lightweight PHP Framework

I disliked the amount of bloat that the majority of frameworks have. So I created my own. (I know... why reinvent the wheel?)

- Simplistic DB connections 
- Singletons For Utility Classes
- A router which supports variables and redirects for old code.
- A controller system with namespacing.
- Smarty template engine
- Some utility functions.

That's about it...
